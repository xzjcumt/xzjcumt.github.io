      <p align="left"><em><strong>The Walking Dead is a good  zombie drama. Instead of being a variation of undead zombies in Resident Evil,  in The Walking Dead they are civilians. The threat comes not only from the zombies,  but also from the contradictions between human, which can reflect the current  social reality. The show portrays the character's psychological activity and  the change, and the dark side of human nature is revealed in the catastrophe...  In the story, the protagonist has been thrown into despair again and again,  meanwhile, it also gives the viewer a disappointment just like the end of the  world.</strong></em></p>
